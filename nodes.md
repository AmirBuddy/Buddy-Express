Introduction

Express is a popular framework + We're Iranian = So why not build our own version of this framework?

Requirements

We should be able to install your framework using npm install amirexpress

We should be able to create an AmirExpress app using const app = amirexpress()

We should be able to add middlewares using app.use((req, res, next) => {})

We need to be able to define get, post, put and delete routes

This framework needs to be strongly typed using TypeScript.

Required response methods: res.end(), res.json() and res.redirect()

We should be able to access URL query parameters using req.query

We need a built-in middleware to serve static files
